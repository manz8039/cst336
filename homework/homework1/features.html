            The two biggest additions to your iDevice's arsenal after jailbreaking is utility, and theming. Usually, apps that make it 
            to the App Store have limited access to the hardware of the iDevice. With root access, you can now download modifications, 
            more commonly known as <em>tweaks</em>, that allow you to have added functionality. This can include better notification
            handling, added modules in the control center, and even a usable file tree into your device's inner system.
            
            But perhaps the funnest part about having a jailbroken phone is the ability to theme. Theming engines like Winterboard and Anemone
            allow users to download stylistic tweaks, known as <em>themes</em> (duh), and truly make your iDevice yours! Above are just a few
            examples of what you can do when it comes to making your device <em>yours</em>.
