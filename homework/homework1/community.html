            With challenges comes community, and the jailbreak community is no different. The jailbreaking scene
            goes as far back as iOS 1 and continues to thrive long after. With so many risks involving virtually
            unlimited access to your device, the jailbreak community is there to thwart mal-intentioned developers
            and test beta software.
            
            The community is a mix of developers, beta testers, and every day users like you and me. A request for
            a simple change in the system such as giving the screen a warmer light during the after hours to prevent
            your eyes from burning at night (f.lux) gets upvoted by other well wishers and taken on by experienced developers.
            And <em>vioala</em>, a tweak is born. Some of these tweaks even get noticed by Apple and get implemented
            natively in later iOS versions (Night Shift), and developers from the scene have even been hired by Apple.
            
            This community especially shines during releases of new jailbreaks. When complete newbies gain root access,
            there are bound to be problems. Kernel panics, bootloops, the whole nine yards. Ask for help on <mark><a id="reddit" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/jailbreak/">r/jailbreak</a></mark>
            and get your problems solved in minutes. In this community, you're never jailbreaking alone!
