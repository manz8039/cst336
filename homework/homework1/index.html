            At one point or another, Apple device owners have come across the question of jailbreaking their phone. Apple prides itself in offering top of
            the line devices that are a mixture of both simplicity and security. Because of their strict devotion to securing their devices, they leave very little 
            options to the users when it comes to customizability and utility.
            <br /><br />
            Hence, jailbreak software came into existence. Through a sequence of exploits and kernel panics, developers have found ways to "root" Apple devices, giving
            users the power to control their devices like never before. The potential of these systematically sound devices become unlocked, and a community request can
            become a fully fledged feature! Of course, with access comes risks, and every potential jailbreaker should know these risks before sailing uncharted territory.
