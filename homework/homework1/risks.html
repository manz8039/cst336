            The most dangerous quality of this backdoor method to gaining root access to your device,
            <em>doors are open from both sides.</em> This means that while you have complete access,
            so hackers around you. This is the biggest trade off when it comes to jailbreaking, but 
            of course, this is nothing new. The community has put many tutorials in protecting your
            rooted device, as well as many signs that let you know whether you've been hacked or not.
            
            At the end of the day, it comes down to one simple advice, <strong>be smart</strong>. Don't install
            anything you're not familiar with, or anything the community hasn't already tested. Be weary of new
            developers and shoot for open sourced code so that you or some other experienced developer can 
            ensure nothing sketchy is being done under the hood. And the biggest advice from the community,
            don't pirate tweaks. While there are tweaks that are paid, they also provide a guarantee from 
            the developer and the community that this tweak is under control and periodically updated.
            Pirated tweaks are often outdated and even offer avenues of <em>Trojan Horse</em> cases.
            
            The jailbreak community is strict about not promoting piracy, as it has been it's biggest ploy
            against the Library of Congress to keep jailbreaking legal.
